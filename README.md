#Java Cryptography Project (2020–21)
A Java cryptography project I created in 2020–21 at age 14 while learning programming. Demonstrates basic encryption and decryption concepts. Preserved for educational purposes only — not for malicious use.

📜 About :-
This project was created in 2020–21, when I was 14 years old and just starting my programming journey with Java.
It demonstrates basic file encryption and decryption concepts using Java’s cryptography libraries.
Although not written in the most organized way (beginner code!), I’ve preserved it for educational and historical purposes to show my early coding experiments.

⚠️ Disclaimer :-
-> For educational, research, and testing purposes only
-> Must be run only inside a secure, isolated Virtual Machine
-> Not for malicious or unlawful use
-> The author takes no responsibility for misuse or damage

🛠 Features :-
-> File encryption and decryption using Java’s built-in crypto API
-> Command-line interface for encryption/decryption tasks
-> Basic test cases for verification

📂 Project Structure
Main.java              # Entry point
CryptoUtils.java       # Encryption/decryption logic
CryptoUtilsTest.java   # Test cases
CryptoException.java   # Custom exception for crypto errors


🖥 Running in a Virtual Machine (Required) :-
1. Install a VM tool:
    Eg: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player
2. Create a VM and install a fresh OS (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.)
3. Clone the repo inside the VM:

git clone https://github.com/sytaas/Cryptographical-AES-Encryption-Ransomware-Java.git  
cd repo
javac *.java
java Main

4. Keep networking disabled or use “Host-only” mode


📚 What I Learned :-
-> Basics of Java syntax and structure
-> Java’s cryptography API
-> Exception handling and testing
-> Early experience in software design (and what not to do)
